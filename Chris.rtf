\f0\fs24 \cf0 Hello my name is Christopher Keuch and I am twenty years old. I am from New Lenox, Illinois and I have two older brothers. I am currently a junior and I attend Illinois State University. My goal one day is to become a graphic design artist. I enjoy drawing, listening to music, and hanging out with friends. \
